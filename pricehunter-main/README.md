   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\DELL\Downloads\pricehunter-main(1)\pricehunter-main"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-cors requests beautifulsoup4 lxml playwright
   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers:**
   ```bash
   playwright install chromium
   ```

4. **Run the Flask server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## 🧪 Testing the Application

### Test Search Functionality

2. **Enter a search query** (e.g., "iphone", "laptop", "headphones")
3. **Click "Search Products"**
4. **Verify results appear** with product cards showing prices from both platforms

### Test Features to Verify

## 🔍 Search Examples

Try these search queries to test the application:

- `iphone` - Returns 10 products (5 Amazon + 5 Flipkart)
- `laptop` - Returns various laptop options
- `headphones` - Returns audio products
- `macbook` - Returns Apple laptops

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If search shows 0 products:

1. **Check server logs** - Look for error messages in terminal
2. **Verify Playwright** - Ensure browsers installed: `playwright install chromium`
3. **Check internet connection** - Scrapers need to access Amazon/Flipkart
4. **Test manually** - Run `python test_search.py` to debug scrapers

### Common Issues:

- **Permission errors** - Run as administrator or use user installation
- **Missing dependencies** - Reinstall: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Playwright issues** - Reinstall: `playwright install --force chromium`

## 🚀 Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Use production WSGI server** (Gunicorn, uWSGI)
2. **Set environment variables** for Flask
3. **Configure reverse proxy** (Nginx)
4. **Enable HTTPS** with SSL certificates
5. **Set up monitoring** and logging

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the terminal output for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Test with different search queries
4. Ensure internet connectivity for scraping

The application is now fully functional and ready for local testing!
